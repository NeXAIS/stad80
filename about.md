### Course Description 
A central goal in statistics is to use data to build models that allow us to make inferences about the underlying data-generating processes or predict future observations. Although real-world problems are often complex, the linear model frequently provides a good approximation to the true data-generating process. Moreover, linear models possess elegant algebraic and geometric properties and often admit explicit formulas, offering deep insights into various aspects of modern machine learning.  In our experience, the insights gained from linear models are broadly applicable, with only rare exceptions.
