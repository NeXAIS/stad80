## Student Survey of Teaching

You will have multiple opportunities to provide feedback on your experience in this course. Suggestions and constructive criticism are encouraged throughout the course and may be particularly valuable early in the semester. To that end, we may use surveys and/or reflection assignments to gather input on what is working well and what could be improved. You will also be asked to complete an end-of-semester, online Student Survey of Teaching, which could inform modifications to this course (and other courses that I teach) in the future.


## Attendance Policy

All course materials will be shared online after class. You are expected and encouraged to attend and participate in class. There are 10% points for lecture participation. If you have any problems which will cause you to miss a class/lab or an assignment deadline please email me.


## Subject to Change Statement

The schedule for the class beyond next week is subject to change. Please consult the course website to know the latest version of the schedule and syllabus. Any changes in assignments and syllabus policies will conveyed via Quercus announcements.

## Student Resources and University Policies

## Academic Integrity

Academic misconduct of any kind will automatically result in a 0 score on the assignment and your actions will be reported to the university. You can discuss with peers, however your work must be your own. Posting your assignments to internet discussion lists / forums / chatrooms is considered academic misconduct. Directly sharing your solutions with others is also considered academic misconduct.
